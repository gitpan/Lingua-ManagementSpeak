Lingua-ManagementSpeak version 0.01
===================================

Lingua::ManagementSpeak is a tool that generates content that appears real,
sounds official and important, but ultimately means absolutely nothing. It
can output sentences, paragraphs, and whole documents with embedded
structure. The goal is to easily provide filler or lorem ipsen content that
has the potential to pass as real. This module does for geeks what lorem
ipsen does for designers.
